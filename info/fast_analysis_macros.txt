Event selection histograms (current spill/run or longer?)
==========================

Available signals (amplitude)  (???any selection???)
 - beam selection:  BC1, BC2, VC, SiTracker
 - fragment selection: FD, HODO, nFHCal (with calibration applied?) 
 - multiplicity: BD, SiMD, tFHCal, Sci-Wall, TOF-400, TOF-700, DAQ event size (where do we get it?)

2D correlation plots (based on digitized data)
 - obvious correlation: 
     FD vs HODO (sum of amplitudes)
 - trigger event selection: 
     FD vs BD (sum of amplitudes or number of strips)
     FD vs nFHCal
     FD vs SiMD 
     BD vs nFHCal
     BD vs SiMD
     
 - offline event characterization:
    <fragment>      vs      <fragment>
    <fragment>      vs  <multiplicity>
    <multiplicity>  vs  <multiplicity> 


Check of the trigger (current spill/run or longer?)
====================

Select event type via trigger mask and overlay histograms with two triggers (four triggers?):
    CCT1 over BT  (central collision with low thresholds versus beam trigger) (will the thresholds be selected only based on daq speed?)
    CCT2 over BT  (central collision with high thresholds versus beam trigger)
    MBT  over BT  (minimum bias trigger versus beam trigger)
    NIT  over BT  (non-interaction trigger versus beam trigger)

1D historgrams: 
    BC1 Amp, BC2 Amp, 
    FD Amp, nFHCal, tFHCAL  
    BD counts, BD sum, SiMD counts, SiMD sum (sum of amplitudes?)

2D histograms listed above (<fr> vs <fr>, etc?)
